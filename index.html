    <h4>"For most users the UI is the system."</h4>
    <p>Jesse James Garrett's Five Planes of User Experience Design provides a comprehensive framework for creating user-centered digital products.
        His model breaks down the UX design process into five interconnected layers, moving from abstract to concrete.
        This Interactive UX/UI Development Guide enables you to traverse the model from two different perpectives: The "Product Arc" (the developers perspective), and the "Users Arc" (your perspective as a user, not a developer).
        This is a tool for developers, designers, and product managers to understand the UX design process and create better user experiences. Click on the elements to explore each plane in detail.

                User needs - which is about understanding what users want to accomplish and their pain points.
                This plane involves extensive user research to align business goals with user expectations, setting the stage for all subsequent design decisions."

                Functional Specifications - Determining the features and functions that will be included in the product.<br>
                Content Requirements -  Defining the types of content needed to support user needs and business goals.<br>
